# Information
Simplified Commands (SC) is a JavaScript library with the purpose of
making JavaScript development easier and simplified. It comes with a
lot of functions, that's easy to use and much more powerful. To find
exactly all the functions, go to "Notes/List.txt" to line 20. It schould be
pointed out that since this is in its early version, there'll be more
functions added as time flies by.
# Questions and answers from the dev
Q: Where can I find the source code?
A: Enter the Assets folder, and then enter the Functions folder, there
   will be a lot of JS files with different names. All the types of
   functions are sorted in that way.
Q: Am I allowed to edit the source code to fit in my favour?
A: Of course! Change what ever you want. I literally don't care.
Q: When did the work start?
A: It started on March 16, 2024 (Technically March 14, 2024).
